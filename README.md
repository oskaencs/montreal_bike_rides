## Introduction

This project processes data from publicly available sources to create a comprehensive data set that includes both weather data and Bixi bike ride usage data for the city of Montreal in 2021. The weather data provides details on temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity, while the Bixi data contains information about the duration of rides and whether the user is a member or not.

The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and merging to produce the final data set that can be utilized for various data visualization and analysis tasks.
